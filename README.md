## _GHaxZ's dotfiles üõ†Ô∏è_

#### This is a collection of my personal "[dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles)".

## Included are

#### _Configurations for my terminal development workflow:_

- ##### [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) - My terminal emulator of choice
- ##### [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - A code editor and (almost) IDE
- ##### [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - A [terminal multiplexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer)

#### _Shell configurations:_

- ##### [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) - My UNIX shell of choice
- ##### [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh) - A cross-shell prompt
- ##### [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) - A pretty (and fast) system info fetching tool, so I can get imaginary internet points

#### _And other cool tools like:_

- ##### [spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/cli) - A tool for customizing the Spotify desktop client

#### _Also, a collection of shell scripts I wrote (or stole and modified):_

- ##### [cpuinfo.sh](https://github.com/GHaxZ/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/cpuinfo.sh), [raminfo.sh](https://github.com/GHaxZ/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/raminfo.sh), [batteryinfo.sh](https://github.com/GHaxZ/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/batteryinfo.sh) - Display system status in a nice way
- ##### [cheat.sh](https://github.com/GHaxZ/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/cheat.sh) - Integrate the community driven [cheat.sh knowledgebase](https://cheat.sh/) into tmux
- ##### [update.sh](https://github.com/GHaxZ/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/update.sh) - A neat little Linux system update script (currently openSUSE Tumbleweed only, can be easily modified for other distributions)

#### _... and old configurations I used in the past_
